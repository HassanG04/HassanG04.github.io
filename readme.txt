# Hassan Gebril – Personal Portfolio

A responsive personal portfolio website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my background as an AI / Data Science student, my projects, certifications, and contact links.

The site is intentionally simple (no heavy frameworks) but has a few dynamic touches: dark mode, hover effects, and a draggable “Hassan-bot” chat bubble.
